# README

My story and an overview of my Git
 
I have been developing automation solutions for over 5 years utilizing UiPath, Visual Basic and Python. My solutions have helped clients significantly reduce the need for repetitive manual tasks that takes up the majority of typical knowledge workers' time in office. Additionally, I have led and executed successfully multiple enhancement projects ranging from BI dashboards to redesign legacy solutions. I am obsessed about scalable process design, modularized codes and configurable parameters. Some of my best thoughts about the industry are published on Medium and LinkedIn. Be sure to check out some examples of my work in the RPA space in this repo (huytrinhx/RPA)

In May 2021, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University - Tepper School of Business with a master degree in analytics. In my capstone project, I designed and proposed a data-driven grading system that's supposed to autonomously appraise human interview responses, a feature deemed to help a mock interview startup engage with users and scale. This proposed system was inspired by latest researches in information retrieval systems and neural network representation of words. While I could not share the codes and details about the project under confidentiality agreement, this repo (huytrinhx/MSBA21) is a collection of most final projects I've led or contributed during the course of study.

Soon after graduation from Carnegie, I have been exploring several niche areas in the AI field that I'd like to investigate in depth. My goal is to build a robotic arm that can play Go (with me) using the famous AlphaZero algorithm .To date, I have graduated from the following degrees in Udacity:
	- Intro to Self-Driving Cars
	- Deep Reinforcement Learning (huytrinh/Reinforcement-Learning)
Currently in progress with Coursera:
	- Modern Robotics Specialization from Northwestern University
