My story and an overview of my Git
 
I have been developing automation solutions for over 5 years utilizing UiPath, Visual Basic and Python. His solutions have helped his clients significantly reduce the need for repetitive manual tasks that takes up the majority of typical knowledge workers' time in office. Additionally, he has led and executed successfully multiple enhancement projects ranging from BI dashboards to redesign legacy solutions. He's obsessed about scalable process design, modularized codes and configurable parameters. Some of his best thoughts about the industry are found here []

In 2021, he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University - Tepper School of Business with a master degree in analytics. In his capstone project, he designed and proposed a data-driven grading system that  supposed to autonomously appraise human interview responses, a feature deemed to help a mock interview startup engage with users and scale. His proposed system was inspired by latest researches in information retrieval systems and neural network representation of words.

In his free time, he has been pursuing several nanodegrees in Udacity with interest in robotics and autonomous systems. To date, he has graduated from the following degrees:
	- Intro to Self-Driving Cars
	- Deep Reinforcement Learning
